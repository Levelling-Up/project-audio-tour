### How to collaborate on one repo with branches

* everyone clones the project
* you should have a main branch and a develop branch
* main branch is not touched: members can make pull requests and these will be approved centrally when we are absolutely sure a feature/change is working OK
* background material, guidelines and meeting documents are the only files that will be added to the main branch without consultation with the group but with clear commit messages
* we work with the develop branch on a day-to-day basis
* each member creates a branch with topic and initials (example: page-footer-hh)
* **the work on your own branch always starts with a pull request from develop**: in this way you always have the latest code, and you will avoid coding something that creates problems with the code in the develop branch because other members may have merged something
* we will try to **communicate as much as possible when merging is done** so that everyone is aware the code on develop has changed and they have to do a pull request
