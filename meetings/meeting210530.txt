Agenda
Before the meeting all attendees will have read the links and the client brief provided in the repo. They will
have forked the project and successfully deployed the app to Heroku. 
Help will be available 1-2-1 for anyone who is stuck or has questions.
Anyone who hasn't completed the above will be asked to leave the meeting.

1) Tech stack update (frontend)
2) How to work with Git/Github 



Notes & Decisions
-----------------
- We choose PWA and will focus only on the frontend, no backend for the moment 
- Things that we want to implement => home screen button, navbar, language selection (either directly on the home page as a dropdown menu or available on each page in the navbar)
- Erica will add audio tracks on AWS and we will use the URLs within the app

Next Steps
- Pull the latest code from the develop branch 
- Review code by wednesday & choose a screen to work on; drop a message on slack to keep the group updated
- Create your own branch (add initials and description)
- Any questions on the code, please send a message in the group slack 
- Git/Github issues => ask Henriette in the group slack
- Iwona will chair the next meeting, updated time => 8pm BCN/7pm UK
