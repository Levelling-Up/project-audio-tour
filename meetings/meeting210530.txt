Notes & Decisions

Re. meetings and task division:

Re. tech stack:
- frontend: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React Native (Erica, Iwona, Henriette)
- backend: NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL (Frida, Sename)

Re. scope of project:
- the requirements that the client has presented in their brief are not in line with what we can/want to do; based on the advice from Andy and our own preferences, we decided to scale down
- the project has been reduced to 8 elements in the MVP
- the estimated time investment is 30 to 40 hours per week for a team of five people
- the deadline is the 25th of July
- Erica will discuss this with the client and offer them to use this product if they want; they can build on what we will deliver
