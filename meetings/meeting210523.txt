Notes & Decisions
-----------------
Re. meetings and task division:
- the meetings will start at 18.15 (BST) = 19.15 (CET)
- the meeting chair will be rotated among the members of the team
- the person who chairs the meeting will prepare the agenda (all members can propose agenda items)
- the chair also adds notes to the agenda after the meeting (use this template)
- new members can join but will only listen during meetings, and they have to read up and get briefed before they can have any input
- Frida is responsible for the Trello board
- Henriette is responsible for the GitHub repo and for the documentation the project
- Erica is responsible for the client contact

Re. tech stack:
- frontend: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React Native (Erica, Iwona, Henriette)
- backend: NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL (Frida, Sename)

Re. scope of project:
- the requirements that the client has presented in their brief are not in line with what we can/want to do; based on the advice from Andy and our own preferences, we decided to scale down
- the project has been reduced to 8 elements in the MVP
- the estimated time investment is 30 to 40 hours per week for a team of five people
- the deadline is the 25th of July
- Erica will discuss this with the client and offer them to use this product if they want; they can build on what we will deliver

Next Steps
- next meeting on Sunday May 30, Sename will chair and prepare the agenda
- current agenda items: 1) Erica will look at testing; 2) we will check out React Native (except Frida who will be moving this week); 3) how to work with Git/GitHub: agree on worflow
- Erica will be in touch with the client
