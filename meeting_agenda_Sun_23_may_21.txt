Notes & Decisions
-----------------
Re. meetings and task division:
- meeting chair will be rotated among the members of the team
- the person who chairs the meeting will prepare the agenda (all members can propose agenda items)
- the chair also adds notes to the agenda after the meeting (use this template)
- new members can join but will only listen during meetings, and they have to read up and get briefed before they can have any input
- Frida is responsible for the Trello board and for the backend
- Henriette is responsible for the GitHub repo and will work on the frontend
- Erica is responsible for the client contact and will work on the frontend

Re. scope of project:
- the requirements that the client has presented in their brief are not in line with what we can/want to do
- we scale down the project to 8 elements in the MVP


Next Steps
- Erica will be in touch with the client
